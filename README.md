## Background

Life Server is personal data server written in Node.js, originally
based on MIT's [Solid Server](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server).

### Audience

This server is intended for the following audiences:

1. (primarily) Myself. I'm using this as an experimental platform for incubating
    and implementing various [Solid-related](https://github.com/solid/specification)
    and Solid-adjacent specifications and standards.
1. (hopefully) Other developers of user centric offline-first decentralized 
    applications.
1. (to a much smaller extent) End-users interested in running their own file
    sharing server (a minimal Dropbox/Google Drive sort of setup). This server
    is not really ready for mainstream (or even early adopter) usage. 
1. (almost not at all) For system administrators / potential service providers
   interested in running their own multi-user data server.

To put it another way, due to a shortage of engineering resources, the
priorities will be: Developer QoL (Quality of Life) over User QoL over DevOps QoL.

### Roadmap

**Updated:** June 2020.

This is an experimental server focusing on interop exploration and rapid feature 
iteration. "Move fast and break things (and then fix them just as quickly)", to use a tired clich√©.

#### Roadmap Phase One

This phase focuses on general cleanup and refactoring from the source 
`node-solid-server` v4 baseline.

* [x] Remove external dependency on Mashlib and the Data Browser. (The various 
    built-in apps (account homepage, data viewing and file management, sharing 
    and permission management, etc) will be performed on the server side.)
* [x] Simplify architecture, remove a number of non-core components (globbing,
    realtime updates via WebSockets, WebID-TLS local authentication, CORS proxy
    and authentication proxy, storage quotas, external WebIDs).
* [x] Refactor the LDP interface to more closely match the [proposed Solid 
    architecture](https://github.com/solid/solid-architecture/blob/master/server/request-flow.md),
    and to support modular/pluggable storage backends
    beyond the existing File System based one (such as an in-memory store, graph 
    stores and others).
* [x] Bring some external authn-related dependencies (such as the 
    [`oidc-auth-manager`](https://github.com/solid/oidc-auth-manager) and the 
    [`solid-multi-rp-client`](https://github.com/solid/solid-multi-rp-client))
    libs into this repository (to make for a faster release and refactoring
    process).
* [x] Replace logging layer (currently a mix of `console` and `debug`) with a
    dedicated logger like Bunyan or Pino.
* [x] Shorten the WebID Profile URL template for new accounts from
    `/profile/card#me` to `/web#id`
* [x] Simplify the new account templating system (do not create template and
    view copies for customizability)

Bonus/If-time:

* [x] Update `node-mailer` package to latest version
* [x] Update `inquirer` and `commander` packages to latest version
* [x] Make all tests pass on Windows 10

#### Roadmap Phase Two

This phase focuses on exploring some advanced features that may make it into
Solid spec proposals, as well as integration with external Solid-adjacent
projects and specs.

* [x] Fix/update Dockerfile (to enable **[Life Server to be hosted on 
  PermanentCloud](https://permanent.cloud/apps/life-server)**)
* [ ] DID Integration
    * [x] Generate a [`did:web`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-web) DID
      and corresponding keys for the Server itself, during installation.
    * [x] Generate a [`did:web`](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-method-web) DID
      and corresponding keys for each user on account registration.
    * [ ] (in progress) Implement DIDAuth for wallet, hook it up to Login page.
    * [ ] Add [`did:key`](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/did-method-key-js)
        support
    * [ ] Add [Veres One](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/didm-veres-one) DIDs support
* [ ] Interop with Verifiable Credentials
    * [x] Implement 
      [Credential Handler API Wallet](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/credential-handler-polyfill)
      registration when user creates an account.
* [ ] Implement an in-Memory based LDP backend, to go alongside the FS backend.
* [ ] Integrate or implement Static OIDC Client Registration functionality,
    to make interfacing with server-side Solid apps easier.
* [ ] Investigate level of effort required to switch from the current `oidc-op`
    OpenID Connect Provider library to a more widely supported one, such as
    Filip's [`node-oidc-provider`](https://github.com/panva/node-oidc-provider)
    lib.
* [ ] Implement a server-side metadata mechanism, to support being able to
    [record who created a resource](https://github.com/solid/specification/issues/66)
* [ ] _(in progress)_ Experimental integration with 
    [CouchDB](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/intro/)
    (for synchronizing of graphs and documents to mobile and offline-first 
    clients).
* [ ] Explore using an [Encrypted Data Vault](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/secure-data-store)
    as a storage backend. This would require some basic Key Management capability,
    possible based on the [Web KMS spec](http://w3c-ccg.github.io/webkms/).
* [ ] Interop with the Fediverse by implementing [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/)
    protocol.

### Differences from Solid Server

Since [`node-solid-server`](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server) (NSS) is 
being deprecated in favor of [`inrupt/pod-server`](https://github.com/inrupt/pod-server),
this repo intends to be another compatible implementation (the more the merrier!).

**Does not support:**

* Using an external WebID on signup 
* `acl:origin` checking or Trusted Apps (uses [`solid-permissions`](https://github.com/interop-alliance/solid-permissions)  
    instead of [`acl-check.js`](https://github.com/solid/acl-check) for access control)
* Password strength checking on account signup.
* Enforcement of storage space quotas
* WebID-TLS local authentication
* WebSockets
* Globbing

### Value Proposition for Developers

See [Solid and Life Server Value Proposition for Developers](docs/value-proposition.md) 
doc.

## Install

### Pre-requisites: Node.js v12+

* Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows 10
* Node 12+

To run the Life Server server, you will first need to install
Node.js. (The developers recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) 
to install Node.)

### Install `life-server` from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/interop-alliance/life-server.git
cd life-server
npm install
```

### Edit `/etc/hosts` (development/testing only)

To run the account creation on unit tests, `life-server`'s test suite
uses the following localhost domains: `nic.localhost`, `tim.localhost`, and
`nicola.localhost`. You will need to create host file entries for these, in
order for the tests to pass.

Edit your `/etc/hosts` file, and append:

```
# Used for unit testing
127.0.0.1 nic.localhost
127.0.0.1 tim.localhost
127.0.0.1 nicola.localhost
```

### (Optional) Prepare the SSL/TLS certificate

**Local/Development:** `life-server` includes a default `localhost` self-signed
TLS certificate in the `config/` folder. Advanced users may want to create
their own certificates for local testing.

**Production:** Installing `life-server` in a production environment will
require a valid TLS certificate (self-signed certs will not work). In addition,
if you're running the server in Multi User mode, you will need a
[Wildcard Certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate).

### (Optional) Generate a config file

The easiest way to customize `life-server` is by running the `init` wizard.
This will create a `config.dev.js` in your current folder:

```
./bin/server init
```

## Usage

To run your server:

```
./bin/server start
```

After startup, the server is available at the configured server URL (by default,
`https://localhost:7070`).

## Usage with Docker

You can run life-server from our [prebuilt docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/interopalliance/life-server) with the following command:

Run latest build from master branch

```
docker run -p 7070:7070 interopalliance/life-server:master
```

Run a tagged release

```
docker run -p 7070:7070 interopalliance/life-server:{gitTag}
# e.g. docker run -p 7070:7070 interopalliance/life-server:v6.0.2
```

You can then access the application at https://localhost:7070.

If you want to provide a custom config.js, mount it as a volume:

```
docker run -p 7070:7070 -v $(pwd)/config.json:/usr/src/app/config.dev.js
```

### Build your own Docker image

Clone the repository, then:

```
docker build -t life-server .
docker run -p 7070:7070 life-server
```

## Security

TBD

Note: This is an experimental research server, not for production use.
